       In the world of cinema, staggering box office figures highlight the powerful force that the film industry plays in today's economy. Every minute, theaters worldwide rake in millions as moviegoers flock to catch the latest releases. However, despite the widespread consumption of films, the true extent of the film industry's economic success remains largely underappreciated by the general public. Avatar (2009), for example, made a global box office revenue of $2,923,706,026, which is enough to buy 7500 average-priced family homes in the United States, or purchase a fleet of 50 private jets and have leftover money for fuel.

       By visualising data on box office earnings, production budgets, and global market trends, a project such as this one can effectively showcase the economic significance of filmmaking.
